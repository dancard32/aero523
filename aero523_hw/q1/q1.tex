An aircraftâ€™s propeller consists of a rigid hub of radius $R$ and a flexible tapered blade of length $3R$ that has density $\rho (kg/m^3)$. The propeller is rotating about the center of the hub with a steady angular velocity $\omega$, thereby creating an effective axial distributed force in the blade. Neglect forces due to gravity. The cross sectional area distribution of the blade is $A(r)$, defined as

\begin{equation*}
    \input{q1/test}, \quad \text{if}\ R < r< 4R
\end{equation*}
