\subsection{Implementing Mach Number Jumps}
[25\%] Implement the mesh adaptation algorithm based on the Mach number jumps. Run your algorithm for $\alpha = 1\degree$ with at least 5 adaptive iterations, and perform the following post-processing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Plot the sequence of your adapted meshes.
    \item Plot the Mach number and total pressure fields on your finest mesh.
    \item Plot the ATPR output versus number of cells in the mesh -- one data point per adaptive iteration.
\end{itemize}

Discuss the results, including areas targeted for adaption and the convergence of the output.
