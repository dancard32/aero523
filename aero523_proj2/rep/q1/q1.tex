\subsection{Implementation of Roe Flux}
[10\%] Write a function that computes the Roe flux, with $\epsilon = 0.1c$ for the entropy fix. Test
your flux with several cases, including subsonic and supersonic states, and varying normal
vectors. In your report, describe your implementation and your tests.
