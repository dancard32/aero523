\subsection{Implementing Finite Volume Method}
[25\%] Implement a first-order finite volume method to obtain a steady-state flow solution on a given mesh. The code should:

\begin{itemize}
    \item read and process the mesh files,
    \item iterate until the residual norm is less than the specified tolerance,
    \item calculate the average total pressure recovery output,
    \item monitor and log the residual norm and output convergence
\end{itemize}

You may also wish to equip your code with the ability to write restart files at the end of
the simulation and periodically during a run. In your report, describe your code structure,
algorithms, and data structures.
