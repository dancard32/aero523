\subsection{Adaptive Iterations}
[15\%] Perform adaptive iterations for $\alpha = [0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3]$ degrees. Run the same number of adaptive iterations for each $\alpha$ at least 5. Plot the ATPR output from your finest mesh versus alpha, and discuss the trend. Include flowfield plots to augment your discussion.
