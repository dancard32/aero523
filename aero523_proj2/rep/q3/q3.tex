\subsection{Convergences}
[15\%] Run your code on the baseline mesh at $\alpha = 1\degree$ , starting with a uniform freestream state at this $\alpha$. Perform the following post-processing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Plot the convergence of the given residual $L_1$ norm versus time step iterations.
    \item Plot the convergence of the ATPR output versus time step iterations.
    \item For the converged solution, make two field plots: one of the Mach number, and one of the total pressure.
\end{itemize}
